## Import to IntelliJ (or Android Studio) ##

1. Get a new fresh clone of the project.
2. In IntelliJ, choose "Open project" and select this project.
3. Let IntelliJ do its thing (probably asking for a restart) and wait until
   nothing is happening anymore.
4. IntelliJ will complain about being unable to load modules. Choose to "Remove
   [the] Selected" modules.
5. Open the Changes plugin and revert any changes made to .idea/modules.xml.
6. Done!
